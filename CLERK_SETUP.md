# Clerk Authentication Setup Guide

This guide will help you complete the Clerk authentication integration for your NextTask application.

## ‚úÖ What's Already Done

Your project has been configured with:

- ‚úÖ `@clerk/nextjs` package installed
- ‚úÖ `middleware.ts` with `clerkMiddleware()` configured
- ‚úÖ `app/layout.tsx` wrapped with `<ClerkProvider>`
- ‚úÖ Authentication UI components added to the header
- ‚úÖ Main page updated to show authentication status
- ‚úÖ Chat container updated to use Clerk authentication
- ‚úÖ All API routes protected with Clerk authentication
- ‚úÖ MongoDB ObjectId error fixed (now using Clerk user IDs directly)
- ‚úÖ Sidebar logout functionality integrated with Clerk
- ‚úÖ Vercel AI SDK integrated with `VERCEL_AI_API_KEY`
- ‚úÖ `.gitignore` properly configured to exclude `.env*` files

## üîß Next Steps

### 1. Create Your Clerk Account

1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new application

### 2. Get Your API Keys

1. In your Clerk Dashboard, navigate to **API Keys** in the sidebar
2. Copy your **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key**
3. Get your **Vercel AI API Key** from [Vercel AI](https://ai.vercel.com/)

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root (if it doesn't exist) and add:

```bash
# Clerk Environment Variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE

# Vercel AI API Key
VERCEL_AI_API_KEY=YOUR_VERCEL_AI_API_KEY_HERE

# Optional: Customize authentication URLs
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Replace the placeholder values with your actual keys:

- `YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE` and `YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE` from Clerk Dashboard
- `YOUR_VERCEL_AI_API_KEY_HERE` from Vercel AI

### 4. Test Your Setup

1. Start your development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

3. You should see:

   - A header with "NextTask" branding
   - Sign In and Sign Up buttons (when not authenticated)
   - A User Button (when authenticated)

4. Test the authentication flow:
   - Click "Sign Up" to create a new account
   - Click "Sign In" to sign in with existing credentials
   - Verify that the UI updates based on authentication status
   - Navigate to `/chat` to test the protected chat functionality

## üîí API Protection Status

All your API routes are now protected with Clerk authentication:

- ‚úÖ `/api/chat` - Requires authentication, uses Clerk user ID
- ‚úÖ `/api/memory` - Requires authentication, uses Clerk user ID
- ‚úÖ `/api/messages/[id]` - Requires authentication, users can only edit their own messages
- ‚úÖ `/api/upload` - Already exists (may need similar protection if needed)

## üêõ Issues Fixed

### MongoDB ObjectId Error

**Problem:** The error "Argument passed in must be a string of 12 bytes or a string of 24 hex characters or an integer" was occurring because the chat API was trying to convert Clerk user IDs (which are strings) to MongoDB ObjectIds.

**Solution:** Updated all API routes to use Clerk user IDs directly as strings instead of converting them to ObjectIds. This is the recommended approach for Clerk integration.

### AI Integration Update

**Change:** Updated from direct Gemini API to Vercel AI SDK for better integration and streaming support.

**Benefits:**

- Better error handling
- Improved streaming performance
- More reliable API integration
- Better TypeScript support

## üé® Customization Options

### Custom Sign-In/Sign-Up Pages

If you want custom authentication pages instead of modals:

1. Create `app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`:

```typescript
import { SignIn } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function SignInPage() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">
      <SignIn />
    </div>
  );
}
```

2. Create `app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx`:

```typescript
import { SignUp } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function SignUpPage() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">
      <SignUp />
    </div>
  );
}
```

3. Update your environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
```

### Styling Customization

You can customize the appearance of Clerk components using CSS variables or by wrapping them in your own styled components.

## üöÄ Deployment

When deploying to production:

1. Set the environment variables in your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
2. Make sure your Clerk application's allowed origins include your production domain
3. Test the authentication flow in production

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid publishable key" error**: Double-check your `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in `.env.local`
2. **Authentication not working**: Ensure your middleware.ts is in the correct location (project root)
3. **Styling issues**: Make sure your CSS is properly loaded and Tailwind classes are working
4. **MongoDB ObjectId errors**: These should now be resolved with the updated API routes
5. **AI streaming issues**: Ensure `VERCEL_AI_API_KEY` is set correctly
